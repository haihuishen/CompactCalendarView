# CompactCalendarView
CompactCalendarView is a simple calendar view which provides scrolling between months. It's based on Java's Date and Calendar classes. It provides a simple api to query for dates and listeners for specific events.  For example, when the calendar has scrolled to a new month or a day has been selected.
Still under active development.

# Example usage
It is possible to change the appearance of the view via a few properties. This includes the background color, text color, textsize color of the current day and the color of the first day of the month.

```xml
    <com.github.sundeepk.compactcalendarview.CompactCalendarView
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/compactcalendar_view"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:paddingRight="10dp"
        android:paddingLeft="10dp"
        android:layout_height="250dp"
        app:compactCalendarTextSize="12sp"
        app:compactCalendarBackgroundColor="#ffe95451"
        app:compactCalendarTextColor="#fff"
        app:compactCalendarCurrentSelectedDayBackgroundColor="#E57373"
        app:compactCalendarCurrentDayBackgroundColor="#B71C1C"
        app:compactCalendarMultiEventIndicatorColor="#fff"
        />

```

Please see Sample app for full example.

```java
    // ... code omitted for brevity         
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        final CompactCalendarView compactCalendarView = (CompactCalendarView) findViewById(R.id.compactcalendar_view);
        
        // Add event 1 on Sun, 07 Jun 2015 18:20:51 GMT
        Event ev1 new Event(Color.GREEN, 1433701251000L, "Some extra data that I want to store.");
        compactCalendar.addEvent(ev1);

        // Added event 2 GMT: Sun, 07 Jun 2015 19:10:51 GMT
        Event ev2 = new Event(Color.GREEN, 1433704251000L);
        compactCalendar.addEvent(ev2);

        // Query for events on Sun, 07 Jun 2015 GMT. 
        // Time is not relevant when querying for events, since events are returned by day. 
        // So you can pass in any arbitary DateTime and you will receive all events for that day.
        List<Event> events = compactCalendar.getEvents(1433701251000L); // can also take a Date object
        
        // events has size 2 with the 2 events inserted previously
        Log.d(TAG, "Events: " + events);

        // define a listener to receive callbacks when certain events happen.
        compactCalendarView.setListener(new CompactCalendarView.CompactCalendarViewListener() {
            @Override
            public void onDayClick(Date dateClicked) {
                List<Event> events = compactCalendarView.getEvents(dateClicked);
                Log.d(TAG, "Day was clicked: " + dateClicked + " with events " + events);
            }

            @Override
            public void onMonthScroll(Date firstDayOfNewMonth) {
                Log.d(TAG, "Month was scrolled to: " + firstDayOfNewMonth);
            }
        });
    }

```

You can modify indicators using a preset of styles, below is an example, but few other combinations are also possible:

Note that the calendar makes no attempt to de-duplicate events for the same exact DateTime. This is something that you must handle your self if it is important to your use case.

# Locale specific settings
It's possible to set the locale so that weekday column names are automatically set by the calendar.
```java
        CompactCalendarView compactCalendarView = (CompactCalendarView) findViewById(R.id.compactcalendar_view);
        compactCalendarView.setLocale(Locale.CHINESE);
        compactCalendarView.setUseThreeLetterAbbreviation(true);
```

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.sundeepk:compact-calendar-view:1.9.4'
}

```
